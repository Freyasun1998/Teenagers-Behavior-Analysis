10,HoldingUrineIsBad,l1lrge,838,14,I wrote a bot that counts the amount of times cum is said in the comments. This time it is slightly different though. WELCOME TO CUM COUNTER 2,"#Thank you all for participating, I have disabled the bot for now. I will probably do something with a bot later but this post will no longer update.

I wrote a program to count however many times somebody says 'cum' in the comments. It will count multiple if there is more than one per comment. However, this time it is different, you are now working together to try to hit 1 billion adjusted cum before I shut it off. There is a slight change though:

##The higher score a comment has, the more cum score it gets.

Each red arrow will multiply that comment's cum-score by 1.2

This isn't an attack on white people or men but rather to say that people other than the dominant group gotta learn about this too. I wanna see more Latino, Asian, Middle Eastern and Black young commies. Even if you're going to use the typical arguments against communism/ socialism (it's complicated and I won't claim to fully understand it), please at least watch some videos and maybe read some theory.

408,Specialist-Thing-916,s83vld,140,4,I just saw a post about a poll asking if we support LGBTQ+ and the majority was saying no.,"I just found it funny how people used the same argument most use when saying no to that question. It's either always ""I don't support them because they're always shoving it down our throats"" or ""I don't support them because not because I hate them but because I'm just letting them be. I'm not getting involved with them"" a mod closed down the comments to that post because of ""LGBTQ phobic comments"" and I just wanna say the mod that closed it down. Why???. Dude I checked every single comment on that post and didn't find a single phobic comment. I'm not attacking anyone so you can't take this down I'm just asking a question and calling you out. I didn't see a single comment in there that was phobic so why did you lie and say you closed it down cuz of that?"

there were so many teenage girls there (i’m one myself) 🧍🏽‍♀️ but like two of them would just stare you down and like?? not stop??? 

and there were some who would act like they were trying to go by you and then just plop down in front of you, and be like “oh i can see much better now” like bro??? i know, i was there first 😍 thankfully they left to go do something and didn’t come back so i got my spot back. :/

and then this rando group of girls came behind me, they seemed cool, but i think my backpack bumped into them once or twice, which i apologized for. they seemed cool but another one of them was also staring me down? 🤨 like bro are we about to kiss rn 😍 /j

and they proceeded to make a circle together when what i assume their favorite song came on, and purposefully knocked into both me and my sister over and over again.

i get it! it’s a concert, have fun! but not at others expense. i ended up knocking into them a few times as well (on purpose which was petty, but nowhere near as excessive as they were being) and they also tried to shove their way past me and my sister but we didn’t let them bc like bro??? tf??

there were also people there faking trying to find their mom so they could get better spots. which made me sad because like do you not have any respect for any other people?

i stepped on someone’s foot and apologized profusely, and every time i bumped into someone, i’d apologize. :/

i know i’m probably being silly, but i’m just hurt at the fact people can be so rude sometimes. anyway, that’s my vent 😬"

Ive never seen a immigrant talk shit about America and there is a reason for that. They came from a shit hole country where running water was deemed as success and the sound of a bomb going off became normal. If you live in America you are privileged and have no reason that you can’t become successful. There is no systemic racism that is stoping you from becoming successful. If you work 40hrs a week and are poor you have no right to talk shit about billionaires like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos who started there own company and work 120hrs a week living off of ramen. Even now that there billionaires they work 80hrs a week.
588,ImSandwichBoy,wzqrns,123,4,A rant about Andrew Tate,"I know it's hard to take anything seriously on the teenagers subreddit, and I know the fact I am talking about the egghead sigma guy who's fandom is 90% homophobic 12 year olds Isn't helping but please read this before sending me death threats.

First of all, you have all the rights to hate tate, he has said some fucked up shit before. But basically all the bad stuff he has said is in the past while his camera quality still sucked. The grey wall, bad camera, no sunglasses, you get the point.
An example of this, he said men are superior to women in the past, but I've heard him say women are beautiful in a not so old podcast. He has matured, basically
He's not homophobic nor racist either, he said so. Can't say the same about his fandom though.

""Okay fine, but he still said those things, we can't just forget that""

I mean, I said boys are better than girls in kindergarten, should I get cancelled for that?
Austrian funny moustache man probably did good stuff, but he still killed millions.
Tate didn't kill, he said words. And even regrets them.

""Okay, but he's a human trafficker, how can you still support him""

Not much to say about it his other than, he's not
I've never seen good proof other that he moved to Romania since it's easier to you know what there.
And he's not even the only celebrity that has done that.
Besides, people trying to cancel things they don't like isn't new. There were even cases of people taking Tate dming them to make him look bad.

I do NOT support sexism, homophobia, racism, human trafficking in any way or form, I just think people think of tate worse than they should."

621,UwUJazilla,v6hgly,121,5,"As we all know, it's 'Pride Month', and I'd like to stir up controversy here","Before I start, I'd like to explain that this is absolutely not a hateful post. It's merely to discuss the subject of pride and pride month. Anything and everything about the community. I'm also here to give you my input on the topic. As someone who used to identify as queer, I'd like to start out with this: these things(feelings, phases, and thoughts, etc) often do not last long. I am urging you to not start hormone treatment or have any kind of surgery to become your desired gender. You may come to regret this and there will be nobody to blame other than yourself. Nowadays it's like queer people are the norm and cishet people are belittled and told they are insane, etc etc. The community is full of toxicity, and nothing but that. Sure there's a few good people in it, not many, at all. I will say that I believe trans people, enbys, lesbians, gays, bisexual, do exist. So I believe many people genuinely are those things? No, not at all. There's been a steady, rising trend in the past years that show that transgenderism has become more common, this isn't because it's more accepted now. This is because internet access has grown, people want to feel special, more trauma has been given to this generation, and people need to be validated for their existence. The need for external validation and the need to fit in has grown massively. You are not special for being queer, you need to understand this. Genuine transgenderism and the like have been proven in studies to be caused by different brain structure and chemical compositions. So no, it is normal. It is a deficit. I am 17 and have been identifying as nonbinary for about 3 years and have recently gotten rid of the label. I grew up as a tomboy, always liking boy things and dressing like a boy, that doesn't make me a boy. You can have different interests without it being labeled as a boy or girl thing and feeling like you have to identify with those labels. I leave my younger audience with this, you do not need to be queer to be accepted. You are you, be you unapologetically. Please do not change because someone tells you that you are this or that, because phases are normal. There will most likely be a time where you'll look back on you now and realize how silly you might have sounded. Now, again, I am not saying these things aren't real, however it is quite rare for it to be a genuine thing. If you have any questions or wanna debate then hit me with em!"

Now, we're literally the closest I think two people can be (even if it hasn't even been a year). We try to talk every day, we fall asleep talking a lot, and she cares about me more than anyone else I know! She makes me so happy istg... She loves me so gd much, and I love her even more, I could never live without her and she feels just like I do. We'd never ever consider dating (it'd ruin what we have), so that means we can do a lot of sweet shit that people might think we'd do if we were a couple, which is absolutely amazing. Even if we're 8 hours apart and a continent away I've never felt closer to someone, just wanted to tell other people how happy I am :)))

These cases being Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell. For the politically illiterate here Griswold gives us the right to buy contraceptives, as in after banning abortion they wanna ban condoms. Lawrence made anti sodomy laws illegal, yes they wanna ban anal, and Obergefell is what gave us gay marriage. No shock there.

1014,LightningDuat,ljnpfp,102,5,This is me. Accept it. Or go away!,"Right. I am 13, bi-romantic, (I like all genders),  and non-binary/transman. I use they/them, sometimes he/they. 

I like MyChem, PierceTheVeil, FallOutBoy, Nirvana, GreenDay, NIN, SmashingPumkins, Panic!ATD, TwentyOnePilots, Blink-182, BMTH, AliceInChains, AllTimeLow, Paramore, FooFighters, IronMaiden, and so forth. (I have a playlist, just search GERARDWAY on Spotify, and I have a very long playlist of ALL my bands... 300 hours long... ahem.)

I  ageregress. (only when I'm really stressed, sad, or if I'm comfy around people at school. I never regress at home/around family, only at school.)

I self-harm. 4 days clean! :)

I love dogs! I have a Chihauha called LittleMan, I used to have a doggo called Ebby, (Ebineeza, how I called her), but we had to get rid of her, she litterally went to a friends farm, I'm not even joking. We knew the guy who took her. 

I am autistic, and I have ADHD. I am 'less' autistic than the kids at my school, and I'm -hopefully - going to get into a mainstream school, soon! 

I'm quiet, and only speak to people I want to. But- I am good at socialising. 

I play guitar, too! If you touch my guitar, I will.. I'll... umm.. I'll do- something... I'll whack you over the head with a frying pan. NO ONE touches the guitar, apart from my girlfriend. (no more gf.. :()

This is me. And, to be honest, I don't care who accepts me anymore. I'm never changing. I don't need to. 

Who are you?


Edit: Oh, and I had a girlfriend I never told anyone about. But- shh. Angelica never existed!"
