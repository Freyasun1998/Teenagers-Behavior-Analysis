                            <p>This project conducts a series of studies on teenage groups based on users' activities and shared content on Reddit. According to a report by app ape, in 2021, one fifth users of the Reddit app in the U.S. was in the age group of 10-19 years old. Indeed, even elementary and middle school students know using Instagram or other social media platforms to make friends and share their thoughts. And Reddit, as a huge collection of online communities, is considered by 86% of users to be a trusted platform for content. Therefore, we decided to analyze the behavior and psychology of teens based on Reddit Post content can help us understand this group and bring useful business information to individuals whose target customer group is teens. Moreover, the research results can be adopted as references by education policy makers.</p>

                            <p>
                                In the initial stage, we created datasets that collected all the posts and comments from subreddits related to teenager communities, and generated wordcloud. From the wordcloud, we can extract several potentially important topics as follows.

                                    <li>emotion: feel, want, think;</li>
                                    <li>school: bully in school;</li>
                                    <li>family: mom, dad;</li>
                                </ul>

                            <br>
                            <p>After the above basic data exploration and analysis, it was found that the teenagers showed more enthusiasm to discuss topics related to their school life, such as sexual orientation, scores, etc. In order to further explore the topics related to teenage life, we collected external data from the U.S. Department of Education on school graduation rates and bullying rates over the past few years and conducted an in-depth study on Teenager's bully situation and graduation situation together with Reddit content.</p>
                            <p>In addition to understanding what teens are interested in, we also want to know about the activities and trajectories of teens on the platform. This can not only provide ideas for optimizing the user experience, but also help the platform run and manage better. To be more specific, our project also takes into account that reddit, as a commercial product, needs to have a reliable profit model, and advertising revenue is very important for this type of social media platform that relies on user-generated content. Therefore, it is worth studying how to sell different sections on the teenager related subreddits of the website to merchants who need to advertise at tiered prices.</p>

                                        and comments by teenagers. Since teenagers often have great conflicts with their
                                        families, find the most negative and positive 10 words and sentences are used.

                                        Business goal: Distinguish the activities/hobbies (music/sport/art) that teens may be interested in, which may be helpful when targeting relevant ads on subreddit forums.

                                        Technical proposal: Use "sports", "art", "music" as labels to find relevant sumbissions, process text using Stopwords and tokenization, train classification model using algorithm such as regression or naive bayes.

                                        Technical proposal: select the variable which can be used to hint weather the author is a good submitter, such as selftext, created_time and so on. Then use Spark MLlib to build Pipelines and do logistic regression analysis, find the most important factors which relates to a good author. Through this process, we can create new variables like avg(score) to evaluate the authors general performance. We can also do some normalization to improve the reliability of the results.

                                        Business goal: Find the top 10 posts about the issues related LGBTQ+ that has
                                        struck a
                                        chord with most commentators.

                                        Technical proposal: We found that many teenagers talking about the issues
                                        related LGBTQ+
                                        had struck a chord with commentators. So we planed to use the keywords "lesbian,
                                        gay,
                                        bisexual, transgender, intersex, queer/questioning, asexual" to find the posts
                                        related
                                        to LGBTQ+. By calculating the number of comments these posts got and ordering
                                        them in a
                                        descent order, we can sort out the most commented posts about the related
                                        LGBTQ+.
                                    </p>

                                        Business goal: Determine the attitudes of teenagers in regard to studying and
                                        higher

                                        Technical proposal: Use "studying"/"education" keywords
                                        (university/tuition/college/...) to filter the submissions/comments that match
                                        these
                                        keywords. Conduct NLP sentiment analysis to investigate the teenagers' attitudes
                                        toward
                                        this topic. Since some possible keywords are frequently used vocabularies among
                                        teens,
                                        it may require strict keywords selection or requires some keywords appears
                                        together,
                                        in order to accurately locate those rows that match the requirements.

                                        Technical proposal:People sharing similar hobbies and taste are more likely to
                                        become
                                        friends. Teenagers are enthusiastic about talking their favorite things to find
                                        peers having similar taste with them. The topics can be various, like type of
                                        fries,
                                        game, sports, etc. We will calculate the 'popular score' according to the word
                                        count of
                                        the comments and upvote number.

                                        Categorize the external data with different traits, such as age, gender, ethnicity, and other characteristics, to compare the bullying rates and observe the year-by-year trends.

                                        One possible factor may be the subreddits' activity. Thus we can use the number of comments in each time period to measure, such as extract the hour part of the variable created_time and create time series plot find the time of day when teenagers are most active on the subreddit.

                                        share the age they got first kiss. Use NLP to identify the age number mentioned
